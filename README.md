# CV_WebDev 
CV_WevDev is just a simple try to display my Resume on WebSite with help of HTML and CSS. 
Tried this to display it on Git Pages as a website 
You can see this on https://komaleshdpgit.github.io/CV_WebDev/

Other components will be added soon to make it a perfect, good looking and a workign model of a website with multiple functionalities

At this stage of Engineering WebDev being a basic and most underrated software development project I still wanted to learn WebDev as it is still used in many companies and has different forms 
Learning new tech and understanding the FrontEnd and BackEnd of a Website gives the insights of how any Software works and hence helps to understand the structural working of any software
